# README
This app was created to demonstrate skills with react and laravel. It uses react router, redux, and material ui.

You are able to register, login, view movies and create movies. The json can be viewed as well.  
Available routes:
/login -> Login page  
/register -> Registration page
/movies -> Movie page
/json -> Page that displays the json of the movies

Movies can be added by clicking the + button at the bottom of the screen. Movies should take a name, year, a movie db id, and a rotten tomatoes stub

To find movie db id, search the movie db with the movie you want and take the numerical id in the URI. For example, the link for forrest gump is https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/13-forrest-gump?language=en-US. The id is 13.

To find the rotten tomatoes stub, search rotten movies with the movie and take the URI. The link is https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/forrest_gump. forrest_gump should be put into the form.

The image, imdb link, and score is pulled from the movie dbs api. The rotten tomatoes stub is just used to create a link to rotten tomatoes.

The forms do not have any validation because I did not have time to add this in.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
